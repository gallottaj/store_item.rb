use require to import data into file ex: require './employee.rb' - order of import
matters - use this to seperate classes and modules in different folders/files
use module to DRY inherited class that have same methods (or need different)
highlight cmd shft bracket to indent whole code
can wrap a class in a module so it doesnt conflict
modulename::classname to reference a module in a class 
module - name with "able" ending - to add an exception method - need to write include method under class.
