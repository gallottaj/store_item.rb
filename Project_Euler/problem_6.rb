# The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

# 12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
# The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

# (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
# Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

# Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


#squares of the first 10 natural numbers:
  #loop
  #exponentiation operator n**2

#  n = 1


# 10.times do
#   n = n**2 
# end

n = [1,2,3,4,5].square!
